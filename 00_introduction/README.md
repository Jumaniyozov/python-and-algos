# Introduction to the Python & Algorithms Curriculum

Welcome to this comprehensive learning resource for Python programming and Algorithms/Data Structures!

## What This Curriculum Covers

This curriculum is designed as a complete, book-like learning resource divided into 5 major parts:

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals (Chapters 1-8)
Learn core Python concepts from scratch, including:
- Basic syntax, data types, and collections
- Control flow and functions
- Object-oriented programming
- Modules, packages, and file I/O

### Part 2: Standard Library Deep Dive (Chapters 9-15)
Master Python's powerful standard library:
- Itertools, functools, and functional programming
- String processing and regular expressions
- Date/time handling and timezones
- Concurrency (threading, multiprocessing, asyncio)
- Testing, debugging, and profiling

### Part 3: Advanced Python (Chapters 16-22)
Explore advanced Python features:
- Metaclasses and advanced OOP patterns
- Generators, iterators, and context managers
- Type system and static analysis
- Memory management and optimization
- Niche features and hidden gems
- Performance optimization techniques

### Part 4: Essential External Libraries & Tools (Chapters 23-26)
Learn industry-standard development tools:
- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework
- **uv**: Modern, fast package management
- **Black, Ruff, mypy**: Code quality and linting
- **Rich, Pydantic, Click**: Essential utility libraries

### Part 5: Algorithms & Data Structures (Chapters 27-45)
Master computer science fundamentals:
- Complexity analysis and Big O notation
- Core data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables)
- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, DFS, BFS, dynamic programming)
- Problem-solving patterns and interview techniques

## Who This Is For

- **Beginners**: Start from Chapter 1 and work through sequentially
- **Intermediate Python developers**: Jump to Part 3 (Advanced Python) or Part 5 (Algorithms)
- **Interview preparation**: Focus on Part 5, especially chapters on patterns and problem-solving
- **Professional developers**: Use as a reference for specific topics

## How to Use This Curriculum

### Learning Path
1. Start with `roadmap.md` to choose your learning path
2. Each chapter has multiple files:
   - `README.md` - Overview and learning objectives
   - `theory.md` - Detailed explanations
   - `examples.md` - Annotated code examples
   - `exercises.md` - Practice problems
   - `solutions.md` - Detailed solutions
   - `tips.md` - Tips, tricks, and gotchas
   - `.py` files - Runnable Python code

3. Work through sections in order within each chapter
4. Try examples and exercises before looking at solutions
5. Run code examples to reinforce learning

### Tracking Progress
- Use `PROGRESS.md` in the root directory to track completion
- Mark chapters/sections as you complete them
- Revisit challenging topics as needed

## Key Features

### Python 3.14 Focus
All code uses modern Python 3.14+ syntax and features:
- Type parameter syntax (PEP 695)
- Pattern matching (PEP 636)
- Exception groups (PEP 654)
- Latest type system improvements

### Niche Features Included
Each chapter highlights lesser-known but powerful features:
- Walrus operator patterns
- Ellipsis object uses
- Positional-only and keyword-only parameters
- Module-level magic methods
- Advanced descriptor patterns

### Algorithm Patterns
Every algorithm chapter includes:
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Multiple solution approaches
- Common patterns and templates
- Edge cases and pitfalls
- Interview tips and tricks

## Prerequisites

See `prerequisites.md` for detailed requirements. Brief overview:
- Basic computer literacy
- No prior programming experience required for Part 1
- For Parts 3-5: completion of earlier parts recommended

## Getting Help

- Each chapter's `README.md` has learning objectives
- Check `tips.md` in each chapter for common pitfalls
- Run example code to see concepts in action
- Refer to `CLAUDE.md` in root for development guidelines

## Curriculum Philosophy

This curriculum emphasizes:
- **Practical learning**: Real-world examples and use cases
- **Progressive difficulty**: Concepts build on each other
- **Depth over breadth**: Comprehensive coverage of important topics
- **Modern practices**: Latest Python features and industry standards
- **Interview readiness**: Problem-solving patterns and techniques

## Next Steps

1. Read `prerequisites.md` to ensure you're ready
2. Review `roadmap.md` to choose your learning path
3. Start with your first chapter!
4. Keep track of your progress in `PROGRESS.md`

Happy learning!
