# Chapter 22: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Writing performant Python code requires understanding profiling, algorithmic complexity, and optimization techniques. This chapter covers practical performance optimization.

## Topics Covered
- Profiling and benchmarking (cProfile, timeit)
- Algorithmic optimization
- Data structure selection
- Caching strategies (lru_cache, custom caches)
- Lazy evaluation patterns
- C extensions overview (Cython, ctypes)
- Common performance pitfalls

## Learning Objectives
- Profile Python code to find bottlenecks
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Implement effective caching
- Apply lazy evaluation
- Understand when to use C extensions
- Avoid common performance mistakes

## Why This Matters
Performance optimization is crucial for:
- Scalable applications
- Real-time systems
- Data-intensive processing
- Resource optimization

## Time Estimate: 10-12 hours
