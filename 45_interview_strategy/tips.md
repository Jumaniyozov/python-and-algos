## Pattern Recognition Master Guide

### How to Identify Patterns Quickly

**Step 1: Read the problem carefully**

**Step 2: Identify keywords**

```
Keywords → Pattern

"subarray" → Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
"substring" → Sliding Window, Hash Map
"palindrome" → Two Pointers, DP
"sorted array" → Binary Search, Two Pointers
"binary tree" → DFS, BFS
"graph" → DFS, BFS, Union Find
"shortest path" → BFS, Dijkstra
"maximum/minimum" → DP, Greedy, Heap
"k largest/smallest" → Heap, Quickselect
"in O(log n)" → Binary Search
"parentheses" → Stack
"top k" → Heap
"intervals" → Sorting, Greedy
"combination/permutation" → Backtracking
"design" → Multiple Data Structures
```

**Step 3: Check constraints**

```
Constraints → Approach

n ≤ 100: O(n³) possible
n ≤ 1000: O(n²) possible
n ≤ 10⁵: O(n log n) or O(n)
n ≤ 10⁶: O(n) or O(log n)
n ≤ 10⁹: O(log n) or O(1)
```

**Step 4: Think about data structures**

```
Need fast lookup → Hash Map
Need min/max → Heap
Need ordering → Sorted Array, BST
Need FIFO → Queue
Need LIFO → Stack
Need prefix search → Trie
Need grouping → Union Find
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes

1. **Not handling edge cases**
   ```python
   # ❌ Missing checks
   def solution(arr):
       return arr[0]  # Crashes on empty array!

   # ✅ Handle edge cases
   def solution(arr):
       if not arr:
           return None
       return arr[0]
   ```

2. **Off-by-one errors**
   ```python
   # ❌ Wrong range
   for i in range(len(arr)):
       if i < len(arr):  # Redundant check
           arr[i] = arr[i+1]  # Index error at i=len(arr)-1!

   # ✅ Correct range
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
       arr[i] = arr[i+1]
   ```

3. **Modifying while iterating**
   ```python
   # ❌ Modifying during iteration
   for item in list:
       if condition:
           list.remove(item)  # Skips elements!

   # ✅ Iterate over copy or use list comprehension
   list = [item for item in list if not condition]
   ```

4. **Not considering time complexity**
   ```python
   # ❌ Nested loops on large input
   for i in range(n):
       for j in range(n):  # O(n²) - might timeout!
           process(i, j)

   # ✅ Optimize with hash map
   seen = {}
   for i in range(n):
       if complement in seen:  # O(n)
           return [seen[complement], i]
   ```

### Communication Mistakes

1. **Starting to code immediately**
   - ❌ "Let me code this up..."
   - ✅ "Let me think about approaches first..."

2. **Not asking clarifying questions**
   - ❌ Making assumptions silently
   - ✅ "Can I assume the input is non-empty?"

3. **Going silent while coding**
   - ❌ Coding in silence for 15 minutes
   - ✅ "I'm creating a hash map here to..."

4. **Not testing the solution**
   - ❌ "I'm done!" without testing
   - ✅ "Let me trace through with the example..."

5. **Being defensive about mistakes**
   - ❌ "But that should work!"
   - ✅ "Good catch, let me fix that..."

## Communication Strategies

### The Perfect Interview Flow

**Phase 1: Understanding (5 min)**
```
You: "Let me make sure I understand the problem.
     [Restate problem]
     Can I ask a few clarifying questions?
     [Ask 3-5 questions]
     Great, so to confirm: [restate with answers]"

Interviewer: "Yes, that's correct."

You: "Perfect, let me think about approaches..."
```

**Phase 2: Planning (5-7 min)**
```
You: "I can think of two approaches:

     Approach 1: [Brute force]
     - Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)
     - Simple but slow for large inputs

     Approach 2: [Optimized]
     - Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
     - Uses hash map for faster lookup

     I think Approach 2 is better because [reason].
     Let me outline the algorithm:

     [Outline steps]

     Let me trace through an example:
     [Walk through]

     Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

     Does this sound good?"

Interviewer: "Yes, go ahead."
```

**Phase 3: Implementing (15-20 min)**
```
You: "I'll start coding now.
     [Explain while coding]
     I'm creating a hash map here to...
     This loop goes through...
     Here I'm checking if..."

[Writing code with clear structure and comments]
```

**Phase 4: Testing (5 min)**
```
You: "Let me test this with the example:
     [Trace through step by step]

     Let me also check edge cases:
     - Empty input: [test]
     - Single element: [test]
     - All same: [test]

     Everything looks good!"
```

**Phase 5: Complexity Analysis (3 min)**
```
You: "Time complexity: O(n) because [explain]
     Space complexity: O(n) because [explain]

     We're trading space for time here, which is
     optimal for this problem."

Interviewer: "Great! Any optimizations?"

You: "For this specific problem, we can't do better
     than O(n) time since we need to examine all elements.
     If space was critical, we could [alternative],
     but it would be O(n²) time."
```

## Time Management

### 45-Minute Interview Timeline

```
0:00 - 0:05  Understanding & Clarification
0:05 - 0:08  Identify Pattern & Approach
0:08 - 0:15  Plan & Discuss Algorithm
0:15 - 0:30  Implementation
0:30 - 0:35  Testing & Debugging
0:35 - 0:40  Complexity Analysis
0:40 - 0:45  Follow-up Questions & Discussion
```

### Red Flags (Time Warning Signs)

```
⚠️ 0:10 - Still clarifying
   → Move to planning quickly

⚠️ 0:20 - No code written
   → Start implementing, refine while coding

⚠️ 0:35 - Still coding
   → Write pseudocode for remaining parts
   → Explain what you would implement

⚠️ 0:40 - Haven't tested
   → Quick trace through one example
   → Mention edge cases verbally
```

### Time-Saving Techniques

1. **Use templates**
   - Have standard patterns memorized
   - DFS, BFS, binary search templates
   - Reduces implementation time

2. **Write modular code**
   - Use helper functions
   - "I'll use a helper function here..."
   - Explain logic, implement later if needed

3. **Prioritize correctness**
   - Better to have correct slow solution
   - Than fast buggy solution
   - Can optimize after it works
