# Chapter 20: Memory Management

## Overview
Understanding Python's memory management helps you write efficient code and debug memory issues. This chapter covers reference counting, garbage collection, and memory optimization techniques.

## Topics Covered
- Reference counting mechanism
- Garbage collection (generational GC)
- Weak references
- __slots__ optimization
- Memory views and buffer protocol
- Memory profiling and debugging

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python's memory model
- Use __slots__ for memory optimization
- Work with weak references
- Profile memory usage
- Identify and fix memory leaks

## Why This Matters
Essential for:
- Performance-critical applications
- Long-running services
- Large dataset processing
- Resource-constrained environments

## Time Estimate: 8-10 hours
