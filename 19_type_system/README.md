# Chapter 19: Type System & Static Analysis

## Overview
Python's type system has evolved significantly with type hints (PEP 484), generics, protocols, and advanced type features. This chapter covers modern Python typing for better code quality and static analysis.

## Topics Covered
- Type hints comprehensive guide
- Generic types (TypeVar, Generic)
- Protocols and structural typing  
- TypedDict and Literal types
- mypy usage and configuration
- Python 3.10+ type features (Union operator, ParamSpec)

## Learning Objectives
- Write type-annotated Python code
- Use generics for flexible, type-safe code
- Implement protocols for duck typing
- Configure and use mypy for static type checking
- Apply advanced type features (TypedDict, Literal, Final)

## Why This Matters
Type hints improve:
- Code documentation
- IDE autocomplete and error detection
- Refactoring confidence
- Large codebase maintainability
- API clarity

## Time Estimate: 8-10 hours
