- Understand when to use each collection type
- Write efficient list and dictionary comprehensions
- Use the collections module (Counter, defaultdict, deque, ChainMap)
- Understand mutability and immutability in collections
- Choose the right data structure for performance

## Quick Reference

```python
# List (mutable, ordered)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuple (immutable, ordered)
point = (10, 20)

# Dictionary (mutable, key-value pairs)
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Set (mutable, unique items)
tags = {"python", "coding", "tutorial"}

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Dict comprehension
square_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
```
