# Collections: Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: List Manipulation
Write a function `rotate_list(lst: list, k: int) -> list` that rotates a list k positions to the right.

Example:
```python
rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)  # [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Exercise 2: Dictionary Operations
Create a function `merge_dicts(*dicts) -> dict` that merges multiple dictionaries, with later values overwriting earlier ones.

## Exercise 3: Set Operations
Write `find_common_elements(*lists) -> set` that finds elements common to all input lists.

## Exercise 4: Counter Usage
Use Counter to find the most common words in a text string (ignore case, exclude punctuation).

## Exercise 5: defaultdict Application
Group a list of tuples by their first element using defaultdict.

## Exercise 6: List Comprehension
Create a list comprehension that generates all prime numbers up to n.

## Exercise 7: Named Tuple
Create a `Person` named tuple and a function to calculate age from birthdate.

## Exercise 8: Deque
Implement a function using deque that keeps only the last N elements added (circular buffer).

## Exercise 9: Nested Collections
Flatten a nested list of arbitrary depth.

## Exercise 10: Performance
Compare the performance of list vs set for membership testing with 10,000 elements.
